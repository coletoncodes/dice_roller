# What It Does

This Flutter Web Application is a basic dice roller application. You can make the die roll at the press of a button. With this app in your pocket, youâ€™ll be able to settle any score on the go!

**You can preview the app [here]( https://coletoncodes-dice-roller.web.app).**

 This will open up a browser version of the application.

# What I Learned

This project taught me the fundamentals of Flutter, Dart, and solidified my knowledge in [Material Design](https://material.io/develop/flutter).

**Some other skills I learned/used with this project:**
- How to use Flutter stateless widgets to design the user interface.
- How to use Flutter stateful widgets to update the user interface.
- How to change the properties of various widgets.
- How to use onClick listeners to detect when buttons are pressed.
- How to use setState to mark the widget tree as dirty and requiring update on the next render.
- How to use expanded to make widgets adapt to screen dimensions.
- Understand and use string interpolation.
- Learn about basic dart programming concepts such as data types and functions.
- Code and use gesture controls.
- Creating a web build in Flutter.

### Features & Ideas For The Future

I would like to keep working on this idea make it take different dice inputs, and display the sum in a pop-up window.
